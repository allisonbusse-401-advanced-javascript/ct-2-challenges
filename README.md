# Insertion Sort
The insertion sort algorithm is a technique to sort the values of an array by iterating through the array with two separate variables and comparing the values to then position them in the correct order. 

## Challenge Summary
This challengs asks us to read through the pseudo code and translate it into JavaScript to write a function that sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm. 

## Approach and Efficiency
I tried to read through the psuedo code and best understand what it was doing first. I found it pretty simple to write out what I saw in JavaScript because comparing the syntax of the two languages was fairly easy. Once it was in JavaScript it was easier to understand what it was doing, and I was able to adjust it to return exactly what I wanted, which was the sorted array.
