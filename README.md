# Insertion Sort
The insertion sort algorithm is a technique to sort the values of an array by iterating through the array with two separate variables and comparing the values to then position them in the correct order. 

## Challenge Summary
This challengs asks us to read through the pseudo code and translate it into JavaScript to write a function that sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm. 

## Approach and Efficiency
I tried to read through the psuedo code and best understand what it was doing first. I found it pretty simple to write out what I saw in JavaScript because comparing the syntax of the two languages was fairly easy. Once it was in JavaScript it was easier to understand what it was doing, and I was able to adjust it to return exactly what I wanted, which was the sorted array. 

# Merge Sort
The merge sort algorithm splits an array in half repeatedly and then sorts each half and joins them back together. 

## Challenge Summary
This challenge asks us to read through the pseudo code and translate it into JavaScript to write a function that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

## Approach and Efficiency
I read through the pseudo code and translated it as best I could to JS. Then I read through and tried to understand how it worked. When it didn't work upon first translation, I tested the merge function first and got that worked, and then tested it fully in the mergeSort function. 

# Quick Sort
The quick sort algorithm picks an element in the array as a pivot point and them partitions the array based on that point. It puts all elements smaller than the pivot before it, and all elements bigger after it.

## Challenge Summary 
This challenge asks us to read through the pseudo code and translate it into JavaScript to write a function that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

## Approach and Efficiency
I was able to translate this straight from the pseudo code and have it work.
